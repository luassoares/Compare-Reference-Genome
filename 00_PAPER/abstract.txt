When the reference genome does not matter—recent and fast divergence species
Abstract: The use of RAD-seq data in population genomics is significantly influenced by bioinformatic processing, particularly in SNP discovery, summary statistics, and demographic estimates. The choice between de novo and reference-based approaches introduces distinct biases, and selecting an appropriate reference genome remains critical. While high-quality reference genomes from closely related species are recommended (Galla et al., 2018; Therkildsen & Palumbi, 2017), there is limited understanding of how closely related the reference should be, especially in rapidly diverging species, and its downstream impact on genetic inference. In this study, we evaluate the effect of reference genome proximity on SNP calling and its subsequent influence on population and phylogenetic analyses using highland Petunia species, a genus characterized by recent and rapid divergence. We employed three different reference genomes, each varying in genetic distance to our focal species. Our results show that while some absolute differences in SNP datasets were observed, the overall interpretation of population structure and phylogenetic relationships remained consistent across all reference genomes. The findings indicate that, in recently diverged species, selection of a reference genome may not be such a crucial issue as had been previously thought. Genetic similarities between the focal and reference genomes are sufficient to return appropriate population and phylogenetic information, therefore relaxing the importance of reference choice for recently diverged species.
