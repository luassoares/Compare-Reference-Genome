**** Welcome to dartR [Version 2.9.7 ] ****

Be aware that owing to CRAN requirements and compatibility reasons not all functions of the package may run after the basic installation, as some packages could still be missing. Hence for a most enjoyable experience we recommend to run the function 
gl.install.vanilla.dartR()
This installs all missing and required packages for your version of dartR. In case something fails during installation please refer to this tutorial: https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartR/wiki/Installation-tutorial.
